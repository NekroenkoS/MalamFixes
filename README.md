# QT Malam Assistant

The QT Malam Assistant is a program designed to assist with two main tasks: calculating working hours versus working hours needed and automatically changing the project number on the Malam website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following ready:

1. **IntelliJ**: Make sure you have IntelliJ installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC).

2. **Malam password**: Ensure that you have your Malam password available. If you need to reset it, you can do so [here](https://payroll.malam.com/Salprd5Root/faces/login.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=rmbdev9rn_33&_afrRedirect=17105649198128190).

3. **Old project**: Identify the project you want to switch from. Note down its project number as displayed on the Malam site. For example: 300123456.

4. **New project**: Select the new project you want to switch to. It should already appear in the dropdown menu of available projects. The new project will have a 6-digit number displayed in the dropdown, but when selected, it will show the full project number.
